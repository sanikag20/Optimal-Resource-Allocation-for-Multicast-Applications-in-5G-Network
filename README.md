# Optimal-Resource-Allocation-for-Multicast-Applications-in-5G-Network

In the recent past, multimedia content has increased significantly on cellphone networks. Such content generates a significant amount of streaming traffic. This project focuses on the traffic generated by live-streaming content over cellular networks. An efficient and dynamic radio resource allocation scheme is required to address the problem of exponentially increasing mobile data traffic.

The project’s key contributions are as follows. We propose a set of low-complexity algorithms for dynamic radio resource allocation for unicast and multicast services in the system. 
The algorithms consider–
1. A stationary system that requires optimal allocation assignment 
2. Dynamic UE arrival and departure. 
3. Handling the users whose allocation is not feasible in the current scenario
4. We also provide proof of the optimality of the algorithms.
